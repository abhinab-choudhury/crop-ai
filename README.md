- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Mongoose** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **MongoDB** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```
## Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB with Mongoose.

1. Make sure you have MongoDB set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your MongoDB connection URI.

3. Apply the schema to your database:
```bash
pnpm db:push
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
