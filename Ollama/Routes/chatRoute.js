**Data Profile:**
- **Farm Location:** ${city}, ${state}, ${country}
- **Farmer's Soil Measurement:** Nitrogen (N): ${N} mg/kg, Phosphorus (P): ${P} mg/kg, Potassium (K): ${K} mg/kg, Soil pH: ${pH}
- **ISRIC World Soil Profile:** Predicted pH: ${soilApiData.ph || 'N/A'}, Predicted Clay Content: ${soilApiData.clayContent || 'N/A'} g/kg, Predicted Soil Organic Carbon: ${soilApiData.organicCarbon || 'N/A'} dg/kg
- **Annual Climate Averages (Based on Last 12 Months):** Avg Temperature: ${climateData.avgTemperature?.toFixed(2) || 'N/A'} Â°C, Avg Humidity: ${climateData.avgHumidity?.toFixed(2) || 'N/A'} %, Total Annual Precipitation: ${climateData.totalPrecipitation?.toFixed(2) || 'N/A'} mm

**Your Task:**
Based on ALL the data above, generate a detailed 12-month crop rotation plan.

**Output Format Instructions:**
You MUST return the response as a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown formatting (like \`\`\`json) before or after the JSON object.

The JSON object must follow this exact structure 

{
  "rotationPlan": [
    {
      "season": "string (e.g., 'Kharif (Monsoon)')",
      "months": "string (e.g., 'June - October')",
      "crop": {
        "name": "string (Name of the recommended crop)",
        "variety": "string (A suitable variety, if applicable)"
      },
      "justification": "string (A concise explanation for why this crop is recommended for this season, considering soil health, climate, and economics.)",
      "keyActivities": [
        "string (A list of 3-4 key farming activities for this crop during the season)"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "overallSummary": "string (A brief, encouraging summary of the plan's benefits.)"
}

**Important:**
- The "rotationPlan" array should contain 2 to 3 crop suggestions, covering the main seasons for the region.
- Ensure all string values are properly escaped within the JSON.
- The entire output must be only the JSON object, starting with { and ending with }.
